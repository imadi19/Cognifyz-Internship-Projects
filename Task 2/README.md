# 🍴 Task 2 – Restaurant Recommendation System (Cognifyz Internship)

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**.  
The objective of this task was to **build a restaurant recommendation system** that suggests restaurants either based on **content similarity** (given a restaurant name) or **user preferences** (filters like cuisine, price range, rating, and city).

---

## 📌 Project Highlights
- ✅ Preprocessed dataset (handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, encoded categorical features)  
- ✅ Implemented **Content-Based Filtering** using **Cosine Similarity**  
- ✅ Two recommendation approaches:  
  - **By Restaurant Name** → Suggests similar restaurants based on features  
  - **By User Preferences** → Suggests restaurants filtered by cuisine, city, price, and rating  
- ✅ Tested with sample inputs and generated meaningful recommendations
